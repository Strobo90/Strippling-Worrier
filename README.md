# Strippling-Worrier

This Game uses the skills I have gain this semester while learning how object-oriented programming works.
This game will have at least 10 classes that performs unique tasks for the proper functioning of the game. 
It will incorporate the core principles of programming with classes which are, abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
This game will also have high maintainability as new feature and update can be added in the future. 
The skeleton of the Game will be the Game templates provided during the course. 
Strippling Warrior will borrow ideas from Greed Game, Cycler and Jumper from previous units of this semester. 
When the game starts its loop, the Strippling warrior will have the ability to move across the screen to go and fight a Gaddianton Robber.
Fruits of life and Forbidden fruits will be falling from the sky. If the Strippling warrior collides with a fruit of life He will gain points. 
If he collides with the forbidden fruit, he will lose points. This is an idea borrowed from Greed Game. 
As the Strippling warrior approaches and fights the Gaddianton Robber, the warrior will gather more points. 
If the Strippling warrior or the Gaddianton Robber gets pushed to the edge of the screen, they die and lose the Game.
This is borrowed from the Cycler Game. 
A message of Death and Game over will appear and the Game stops.
A detailed lay out of the classes will be provided on the Designer Assignment for this project. 
This is a Game designed to teach primary children of the church some gospel principles through gaming.
